# Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the life expectancy of its citizens. By leveraging data visualization and analysis techniques, the project uncovers insights into how economic development influences health outcomes across different nations.

## Introduction
This project aims to answer the following questions:
1. How does GDP correlate with life expectancy?
2. Are there regional differences in this relationship?
3. What outliers exist, and what might they indicate about other factors influencing life expectancy?

By creating compelling visualizations and performing data analysis, this project provides insights that contribute to understanding the global health-economic divide.

## Analysis and Insights
### Key Findings
1. **GDP vs. Life Expectancy**: A positive correlation exists, with diminishing returns at higher GDP levels.
2. **Regional Trends**: Wealthier regions generally exhibit higher life expectancy, while developing regions lag behind.
---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook** for code execution and visualization

---

## Visualizations
Key visualizations include:
1. **Scatter Plot**: GDP vs. Life Expectancy
2. **Regional Comparisons**: Grouped Bar Charts
3. **Time-Series Analysis**: Line Charts
---

## Limitations
- Missing data for certain countries
- Does not account for variables like healthcare expenditure, education, or environmental factors

### Future Work
- Incorporate additional variables to improve analysis
- Expand the dataset to include more recent data
